Note:
Music Match only allows 2k calls per day with their free plan, so during gameplay search results may begin returning
empty no matter what. If that happens, I have provided 1 more API key that you can use. To replace the key, enter
the backend/server.js and find the API Key on line 12 and enter the key below in string format

Additional Key:
